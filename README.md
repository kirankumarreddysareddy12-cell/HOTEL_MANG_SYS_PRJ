# üõí Retail Sales Analysis (Oracle SQL Project)

## üìå Project Overview
The "Retail Sales Analysis" project is built using "Oracle SQL" to simulate and analyze sales transactions in a retail store.  
It demonstrates the complete workflow of creating a database, inserting sample data, and writing analytical SQL queries to answer real-world business questions.

## üîç Example Queries
Here are some of the analytical queries included in the project:

1. Total Sales by Category
   ```sql
   SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
   FROM retail_sales
   GROUP BY category
   ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
2.Top 5 Customers by Sales
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY customer_id
    ORDER BY total_sales DESC
)
WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;
